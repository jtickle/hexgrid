Hexed Colony
============

Get it? It's all hexagonal, and also the colonists have frequent misfortune.

dwest says my READMEs are great, if only I would write some code. I'll probably
flesh this one out later, but for now, only the essentials. I'm just having fun
here. This whole github account is just for fun.


Special Thanks

[Amet Patel](http://www.redblobgames.com) for the Red Blob Games website; the
grid rendering code in this is entirely based on his page on
[Hexagons](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and no matter what I end
up doing with this game, that portion of it will remain Free software since Amet
chose to publish freely online.
